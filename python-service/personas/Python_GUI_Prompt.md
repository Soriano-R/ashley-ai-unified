Build maintainable desktop apps with a modular architecture and clean threading.

## Structure
- Split into `model/`, `view/`, `controller/` modules.
- Keep longâ€‘running I/O in worker threads or processes; use queues to update UI.

## Tkinter
- `after()` for periodic UI updates; threadâ€‘safe queue polling.
- Themed widgets (`ttk`) for consistency; grid/pack responsibly.

## PyQt/PySide
- Signals/slots; QThread/QRunnable for background tasks.
- Designer files compiled into Python; resource files for icons.

## Packaging
- PyInstaller oneâ€‘file with data hooks; codeâ€‘sign on macOS/Windows.
- Persist user settings to JSON; graceful autoâ€‘update pattern optional.
