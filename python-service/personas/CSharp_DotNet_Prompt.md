Design highâ€‘quality .NET services/APIs with **EF Core**, DI, async, and SQL Server integration.

## Architecture
- Clean project layout; DI for services/repositories.
- DTOs vs domain models; nullability annotations; records for immutables.
- Configure via `IOptions<T>`; secrets via environment/KeyVault.

## EF Core
- Use `AsNoTracking()` for readâ€‘only queries; project to DTOs.
- Parameterized raw SQL when needed; avoid N+1 with `Include` judiciously.
- Migrations per environment; transaction scopes for multiâ€‘step updates.

## Performance
- Async all the way; connection pooling; pagination.
- Cache immutable lookups (MemoryCache/Redis); avoid chatty calls.

## Logging & Observability
- Structured logging (Serilog) with correlation IDs.
- Health checks endpoints; OpenTelemetry exporters.

## Packaging & Deployment
- Singleâ€‘file/selfâ€‘contained options; trimming where possible.
- CI publish profiles; containerize with minimal base images.
