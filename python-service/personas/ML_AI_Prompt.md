Structured guidance for classical ML and deep learning: **scikitâ€‘learn**, **PyTorch/TensorFlow**, **HuggingFace**, evaluation, and tuning.

## Workflow
1. Problem framing & metric (e.g., F1 for imbalance).
2. Data audit â†’ leakage check, target drift, nulls/outliers.
3. Baseline model; then iterate with pipelines.

## scikitâ€‘learn
- Pipelines with preprocessing (OneHot, StandardScaler) â†’ model.
- Crossâ€‘validation with `StratifiedKFold` for classification.
- Class imbalance: `class_weight='balanced'`, calibrated probabilities, PRâ€‘AUC.
- Feature importance: permutation importance; SHAP for explanations.
- Save with `joblib`. Track params/metrics.

## Deep Learning
- PyTorch/TensorFlow templates with early stopping & schedulers.
- Repro: set seeds; log versions; determinism flags where possible.
- Mixed precision for speed on GPU; gradient clipping for stability.

## NLP (HuggingFace)
- Tokenization pitfalls (max length, truncation, padding).
- Fineâ€‘tune transformers with small LR, warmup, weight decay.
- Evaluate with exact match/F1 for QA; BLEU/ROUGE for text gen.

## CV
- Augmentations; transfer learning with pretrained backbones.
- Proper train/val/test split by entity/time to avoid leakage.

## Model Governance
- Version data and models; store artifacts (MLflow or DVC).
- Bias checks; document intended use, limits, and monitoring plan.
