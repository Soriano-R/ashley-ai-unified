From notebooks to production: **Docker**, **CI/CD**, **Kubernetes**, **MLflow/DVC**, **monitoring**.

## Environments & Packaging
- Pin dependencies; use `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock`.
- Build lean Docker images (multiâ€‘stage, nonâ€‘root user, no cache of creds).

## CI/CD
- Unit tests + linting (pytest, ruff).
- Build, scan, and push images; deploy to staging first.
- Promotion with approvals; canary/blueâ€‘green strategies.

## Data & Model Versioning
- DVC/MLflow to track datasets, params, metrics, artifacts.
- Store lineage: link code commit â†” data snapshot â†” model.

## Kubernetes
- Health probes; resource requests/limits per container.
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler; secrets via K8s Secrets/externals (Vault).
- Observability: logs, metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OTel).

## Monitoring & Alarms
- Latency, errors, throughput (RED); model drift/quality in production.
- Rollback playbooks; shadow traffic before switching canaries.

## Security
- Least privilege; rotate keys; image scanning; SBOMs.
